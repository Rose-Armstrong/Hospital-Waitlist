# Hospital-Waitlist
🚑 Hospital Patient Waitlist Analysis Dashboard


I’m excited to share a Power BI dashboard I created.
This project challenged me to dig deeper into healthcare data and sharpen my Power BI and DAX skills. I focused on visualising waitlist trends across different patient types, age profiles, and specialties, all with the goal of making complex information simple and actionable.

📸 Check out the images to see the dashboard in action!

🔎 Key highlights of the build:
 ✅ Cleaned and merged multi-year inpatient & outpatient datasets
 ✅ Created dynamic DAX measures for current vs. previous month and year-over-year waitlist tracking
 ✅ Added an interactive Average/Median toggle for flexibility in analysis
 ✅ Built visuals to break down trends by age group, time band, and specialty
 ✅ Developed a Top 5 specialties list based on median wait times to help drive focus

💡 What I learned:
✅ How powerful DAX is for dynamic metrics
✅ The importance of thoughtful data storytelling, especially in healthcare
✅ Median-based insights can reveal hidden patterns that average sometimes mask

🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
 ✅ The total waitlist has increased significantly over the past year.
 ✅ Outpatients make up the majority of the waitlist.
 ✅ The most extended wait times are in Accident & Emergency, Paediatrics Cardiology, and Paediatrics Orthopaedic concerning average.

🎯 Takeaway: Data visualization can help drive better decisions, especially in areas like patient waitlists, where the impact is real.
